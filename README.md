## Goals
- Be a thin, debuggable and battle tested wrapper on top of `go-ethereum`
- Decode all transaction inputs/outputs/logs for all ABIs you are working with, automatically
- Simple synchronous API
- Do not handle `nonces` on the client side, trust the server
- Do not wrap `bind` generated contracts, small set of additional debug API
- Resilient: should execute transactions even if there is a gas spike or an RPC outage (failover)
- Well tested: should provide a suite of e2e tests that can be run on testnets to check integration

## Examples
Check [examples](./examples) folder

Lib is providing a small amount of helpers for decoding handling that you can use with vanilla `go-ethereum` generated wrappers
```
// Decode waits for transaction and decode all the data/errors
Decode(tx *types.Transaction, txErr error) (*DecodedTransaction, error)

// NewTXOpts returns a new sequential transaction options wrapper,
// sets opts.GasPrice and opts.GasLimit from seth.toml or override with options
NewTXOpts(o ...TransactOpt) *bind.TransactOpts

// NewCallOpts returns a new call options wrapper
NewCallOpts(o ...CallOpt) *bind.CallOpts
```

By default, we are using the `root` key `0`, but you can also use `keys` from `keyfile.toml`
```
// NewCallKeyOpts returns a new sequential call options wrapper from the key N
NewCallKeyOpts(keyNum int, o ...CallOpt) *bind.CallOpts

// NewTXKeyOpts returns a new transaction options wrapper called from the key N
NewTXKeyOpts(keyNum int, o ...TransactOpt) *bind.TransactOpts
```

Start `Geth` in a separate terminal, then run the examples
```
make GethSync
cd examples
go test -v
```

## Setup
We are using [nix](https://nixos.org/)

Enter the shell
```
nix develop
```

## Building contracts
We have `go-ethereum` and [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) tools inside `nix` shell
```
make build
```

## Testing
To run tests on a local network, first start it
```
make AnvilSync
```
Or use latest `Geth`
```
make GethSync
```

You can use default `hardhat` key `ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80` to run tests

Run the [decode](./client_decode_test.go) tests
```
make network=Anvil root_private_key=ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 test
make network=Geth root_private_key=ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 test
```
Check other params in [seth.toml](./seth.toml), select any network and use your key for testnets

User facing API tests are [here](./client_api_test.go)
```
make network=Anvil root_private_key=ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 test_api

# Config
### env vars
Some crucial data is stored in env vars, create `.envrc` and use `source .envrc`, or use `direnv`
```
export SETH_LOG_LEVEL=info # global logger level
export SETH_CONFIG_PATH=seth.toml # path to the toml config
export SETH_KEYFILE_PATH=keyfile.toml # keyfile path for using multiple keys
export SETH_NETWORK=Geth # selected network
export SETH_ROOT_PRIVATE_KEY=ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 # root private key
export SETH_ONE_PASS_VAULT=712jkhjdyf71289hdjfs7d # id of 1password vault in which we store secrets

alias seth="SETH_CONFIG_PATH=seth.toml go run cmd/seth/seth.go" # useful alias for keyfile CLI
```

Alternatively if you don't have a network defined in the TOML you can still use the CLI by providing these 2 key env vars:
```
export SETH_URL=https://rpc.fuji.testnet.anyswap.exchange
export SETH_CHAIN_ID=43113

go run cmd/seth/seth.go ... # your command
```
In that case you should still pass network name with `-n` flag, especially when using CLI with 1password as network name is used when generating item name. 

If `SETH_KEYFILE_PATH` is not set then client will create X ephemeral keys (60 by default, configurable) and won't return any funds.
Use `SETH_KEYFILE_PATH` for testnets/mainnets and `ephemeral` mode only when testing against simulated network.

### seth.toml
Set up your ABI directory (relative to `seth.toml`)
```
abi_dir = "contracts/abi"
```

Setup your BIN directory (relative to `seth.toml`)
```
bin_dir = "contracts/bin"
```

Decide whether you want to read `keyfile` or use `ephemeral` keys. In the first case you have two options:
* read it from the filesystem
```toml
# If empty Seth will not try to load any keyfiles. You can either set it to 'file' to load keyfiles from
# a file (providing path to it in 'keyfile_path') or to 'base64_env' to load it from Base64-ed environment variable
# 'SETH_KEYFILE_BASE64'
keyfile_source = "file"

# If keyfile_source is set to 'file' this should be a path to a file with keyfiles
keyfile_path = "keyfile.toml"
```
* read it from environment variable `SETH_KEYFILE_BASE64` (keyfile needs to be base64-ed)
```toml
keyfile_source = "base64_env"
```
If you want to use ephemeral keys, you can set the number of keys to be generated:
```toml
# Set number of ephemeral keys to be generated (0 for no ephemeral keys). Each key will receive a proportion of native tokens from root private key's balance with the value equal to `(root_balance / ephemeral_keys_number) - transfer_fee * ephemeral_keys_number`. Using ephemeral keys together with keyfile will result in an error.
ephemeral_addresses_number = 10
```

You cannot use both `keyfile` and `ephemeral` keys at the same time. Trying to do so will cause configuration error.

You can enable auto-tracing for all transactions meeting configured level, which means that every time you use `Decode()` we will decode the transaction and also trace all calls made within the transaction, together with all inputs, outputs, logs and events. Three tracing levels are available:
* `all` - trace all transactions
* `reverted` - trace only reverted transactions (that's default setting used if you don't set `tracing_level`)
* `none` - don't trace any transactions
Example:
```
tracing_level = "reverted"
```

Additionally, you can decide where tracing/decoding data goes to. There are three options:
* `console` - we will print all tracing data to the console
* `json` - we will save tracing data for each transaction to a JSON file
* `dot` - we will save tracing data for each transaction to a DOT file (graph)
```
trace_outputs = ["console", "json", "dot"]
```
For info on viewing DOT files please check the [DOT graphs](#dot-graphs) section below.

Example:
![image](./docs/tracing_example.png)
These two options should be used with care, when `tracing_level` is set to `all` as they might generate a lot of data.

If you want to check if the RPC is healthy on start, you can enable it with:
```
check_rpc_health_on_start = false
```
It will execute a simple check of transferring 10k wei from root key to root key and check if the transaction was successful.

You can add more networks like this:
```
[[Networks]]
name = "Fuji"
transaction_timeout = "30s"
# gas limit should be explicitly set only if you are connecting to a node that's incapable of estimating gas limit itself (should only happen for very old versions)
# gas_limit = 9_000_000
# hardcoded gas limit for sending funds that will be used if estimation of gas limit fails
transfer_gas_fee = 21_000
# legacy transactions
gas_price = 1_000_000_000
# EIP-1559 transactions
eip_1559_dynamic_fees = true
gas_fee_cap = 25_000_000_000
gas_tip_cap = 1_800_000_000
urls_secret = ["..."]
# if set to true we will dynamically estimate gas for every transaction (explained in more detail below)
gas_price_estimation_enabled = true
# how many last blocks to use, when estimating gas for a transaction
gas_price_estimation_blocks = 1000
# priority of the transaction, can be "fast", "standard" or "slow" (the higher the priority, the higher adjustment factor and buffer will be used for gas estimation) [default: "standard"]
gas_price_estimation_tx_priority = "slow"
```
If you don't we will use the default settings for `Default` network.

ChainID is not needed, as it's fetched from the node.

If you want to save addresses of deployed contracts, you can enable it with:
```
save_deployed_contracts_map = true
```

If you want to re-use previously deployed contracts you can indicate file name in `seth.toml`:
```
contract_map_file = "deployed_contracts_mumbai.toml"
```
Both features only work for live networks. Otherwise, they are ignored, and nothing is saved/read from for simulated networks.

## CLI
You can either define the network you want to interact with in your TOML config and then refer it in the CLI command, or you can pass all network parameters via env vars. Most of the examples below show how to use the former approach.

### Multiple keys manipulation (keyfile.toml)
To use multiple keys in your tests you can create a `keyfile.toml` using CLI

Set up the alias, see `.envrc` configuration above
```
export SETH_LOG_LEVEL=info # global logger level
alias seth="SETH_CONFIG_PATH=seth.toml go run cmd/seth/seth.go"
```

When you run any of the commands from `keys` namespace by default Seth will try to interact with 1password. To do that you need to meet a couple of requirements:
1. 1password desktop [app](https://1password.com/product/mac/) installed.
2. 1password CLI tool called [op](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/)

Now... if you are working with a vault you have access to via your desktop app, it will ask you to authenticate via the desktop app every time you need to access the vault and no further configuration is required. If it's a vault you don't have access to via the desktop app you will need to set service account token in your env vars:
```bash
export OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=...
```

Once you have it setup you can run `op vaults list` to get ids of all vaults you are assigned to. The output will look more or less like this:
```bash
ID                            NAME
4rdre3lw7mqyz4nbrqcygdzwri    Vault 1
r4qs5dh3zwofum2jse7g53cgrm    Vault 2
```

Once you have decided, which vault you want to use you need to export its id in `SETH_ONE_PASS_VAULT` variable. We will use `Vault 1`'s ids in the following examples.

Create a new `keyfile` with 10 new accounts funded from the root key
```
SETH_ONE_PASS_VAULT=4rdre3lw7mqyz4nbrqcygdzwri SETH_ROOT_PRIVATE_KEY=ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 SETH_KEYFILE_PATH=keyfile_geth.toml seth -n Geth keys fund -a 10 [-b 2] [--local]
```
This will create a new Secure Note in 1password called GETH_KEYFILE with file attachment containing 10 new keys. Item name is always `<NETWORK_NAME_>_KEYFILE`. It's crucial that you always pass network name with `-n` flag, as it's used in item name. If it's missing we will use `DEFAULT` network name and it will be impossible to distinguish between keyfiles from different networks.
`SETH_KEYFILE_PATH` is still required, even when using 1password, because if creating the keyfile in 1password fails, we will save it to the file, so that no funds are lost.
Also remember that you don't need to define your network in TOML file as long as you pass the RPC URL with `-u` flag.

Run the tests, then return funds back, when needed
```
SETH_ONE_PASS_VAULT=4rdre3lw7mqyz4nbrqcygdzwri SETH_ROOT_PRIVATE_KEY=ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 SETH_KEYFILE_PATH=keyfile_geth.toml seth -n Geth keys return [--local]
```
Update the balances
```
SETH_ONE_PASS_VAULT=4rdre3lw7mqyz4nbrqcygdzwri  SETH_ROOT_PRIVATE_KEY=ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 SETH_KEYFILE_PATH=keyfile_geth.toml seth -n Geth keys update [--local]
```
Remove the `keyfile`
```
SETH_ONE_PASS_VAULT=4rdre3lw7mqyz4nbrqcygdzwri SETH_ROOT_PRIVATE_KEY=ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 SETH_KEYFILE_PATH=keyfile_geth.toml seth -n Geth keys remove [--local]
```

If you don't want to use 1password you can still use local keyfile by providing `--local` flag.

### Manual gas price estimation
In order to adjust gas price for a transaction, you can use `seth gas` command
```
seth -n Fuji gas -b 10000 -tp 0.99
```
This will analyze last 10k blocks and give you 25/50/75/99th/Max percentiles for base fees and tip fees

`-tp 0.99` requests the 99th tip percentile across all the transaction in one block and calculates 25/50/75/99th/Max across all blocks

### Block stats
If you need to get some insights into network stats and create a realistic load/chaos profile with simulators (`anvil` as an example), you can use `stats` CLI command

#### Define your network in `seth.toml`

Edit your `seth.toml`
```
[[networks]]
name = "MyCustomNetwork"
urls_secret = ["..."]

[block_stats]
rpc_requests_per_second_limit = 5
```

Then check the stats for the last N blocks
```bash
seth -n MyCustomNetwork stats -s -10
```

To check stats for the interval (A, B)
```bash
seth -n MyCustomNetwork stats -s A -e B
```

#### Pass all network parameters via env vars
If you don't have a network defined in the TOML you can still use the CLI by providing the RPC url via cmd arg.

Then check the stats for the last N blocks
```bash
seth -u "https://my-rpc.network.io" stats -s -10
```

To check stats for the interval (A, B)
```bash
SETH_CONFIG_PATH=seth.toml seth -u "https://my-rpc.network.io" stats -s A -e B
```

Results can help you to understand if network is stable, what is avg block time, gas price, block utilization and transactions per second
```toml
# Stats
perc_95_tps = 8.0
perc_95_block_duration = '3s'
perc_95_block_gas_used = 1305450
perc_95_block_gas_limit = 15000000
perc_95_block_base_fee = 25000000000
avg_tps = 2.433333333333333
avg_block_duration = '2s' 
avg_block_gas_used = 493233
avg_block_gas_limit = 15000000
avg_block_base_fee = 25000000000

# Recommended performance/chaos test parameters
duration = '2m0s'
block_gas_base_fee_initial_value = 25000000000
block_gas_base_fee_bump_percentage = '100.00% (no bump required)'
block_gas_usage_percentage = '3.28822000% gas used (no congestion)'
avg_tps = 3.0
max_tps = 8.0
```

### Single transaction tracing
You can trace a single transaction using `seth trace` command. Example:
```
SETH_CONFIG_PATH=seth.toml go run cmd/seth/seth.go -u "https://my-rpc.network.io" trace -t 0x4c21294bf4c0a19de16e0fca74e1ea1687ba96c3cab64f6fca5640fb7b84df65
```
or if you want to use a predefined-network:
```
SETH_CONFIG_PATH=seth.toml go run cmd/seth/seth.go -n=Geth trace -t 0x4c21294bf4c0a19de16e0fca74e1ea1687ba96c3cab64f6fca5640fb7b84df65
```

### Bulk tracing
You can trace multiple transactions at once using `seth trace` command. Example:
```
SETH_CONFIG_PATH=seth.toml go run cmd/seth/seth.go -n=Geth trace -f reverted_transactions.json
```

or using cmd args
```
SETH_CONFIG_PATH=seth.toml go run cmd/seth/seth.go -u "https://my-rpc.network.io" trace -f reverted_transactions.json
```

You need to pass a file with a list of transaction hashes to trace. The file should be a JSON array of transaction hashes, like this:
```
[
  "0x...",
  "0x...",
  "0x...",
  ...
]
```

(Note that currently Seth automatically creates `reverted_transactions_<network>_<date>.json` with all reverted transactions, so you can use this file as input for the `trace` command.)

### Automatic gas estimator

This section explains how to configure and understand the automatic gas estimator, which is crucial for executing transactions on Ethereum-based networks. Here’s what you need to know:

#### Configuration Requirements

Before using the automatic gas estimator, it's essential to set the default gas-related parameters for your network:

- **Non-EIP-1559 Networks**: Set the `gas_price` to define the cost per unit of gas if your network doesn't support EIP-1559.
- **EIP-1559 Networks**: If your network supports EIP-1559, set the following:
  - `eip_1559_dynamic_fees`: Enables dynamic fee structure.
  - `gas_fee_cap`: The maximum fee you're willing to pay per gas.
  - `gas_tip_cap`: An optional tip to prioritize your transaction within a block (although if it's set to `0` there's a high chance your transaction will take longer to execute as it will be less attractive to miners, so do set it).

These settings act as a fallback if the gas estimation fails. Additionally, always specify `transfer_gas_fee` for the fee associated with token transfers.

If you do not know if your network supports EIP-1559, but you want to give it a try it's recommended that you also set `gas_price` as a fallback. When we try to use EIP-1559 during gas price estimation, but it fails, we will fallback to using non-EIP-1559 logic. If that one fails as well, we will use hardcoded `gas_price` value.

#### How Gas Estimation Works

Gas estimation varies based on whether the network is a private Ethereum Network or a live network.

- **Private Ethereum Networks**: no estimation is needed. We always use hardcoded values.

For real networks, the estimation process differs for legacy transactions and those compliant with EIP-1559:

##### Legacy Transactions
1. **Initial Price**: Query the network node for the current suggested gas price.
2. **Priority Adjustment**: Modify the initial price based on `gas_price_estimation_tx_priority`. Higher priority increases the price to ensure faster inclusion in a block.
3. **Congestion Analysis**: Examine the last X blocks (as specified by `gas_price_estimation_blocks`) to determine network congestion, calculating the usage rate of gas in each block and giving recent blocks more weight.
4. **Buffering**: Add a buffer to the adjusted gas price to increase transaction reliability during high congestion.

##### EIP-1559 Transactions
1. **Tip Fee Query**: Ask the node for the current recommended tip fee.
2. **Fee History Analysis**: Gather the base fee and tip history from recent blocks to establish a fee baseline.
3. **Fee Selection**: Use the greater of the node's suggested tip or the historical average tip for upcoming calculations.
4. **Priority and Adjustment**: Increase the base and tip fees based on transaction priority (`gas_price_estimation_tx_priority`), which influences how much you are willing to spend to expedite your transaction.
5. **Final Fee Calculation**: Sum the base fee and adjusted tip to set the `gas_fee_cap`.
6. **Congestion Buffer**: Similar to legacy transactions, analyze congestion and apply a buffer to both the fee cap and the tip to secure transaction inclusion.

Understanding and setting these parameters correctly ensures that your transactions are processed efficiently and cost-effectively on the network.

Finally, `gas_price_estimation_tx_priority` is also used, when deciding, which percentile to use for base fee and tip for historical fee data. Here's how that looks:
```go
		case Priority_Fast:
			baseFee = stats.GasPrice.Perc99
			historicalGasTipCap = stats.TipCap.Perc99
		case Priority_Standard:
			baseFee = stats.GasPrice.Perc50
			historicalGasTipCap = stats.TipCap.Perc50
		case Priority_Slow:
			baseFee = stats.GasPrice.Perc25
			historicalGasTipCap = stats.TipCap.Perc25
```

##### Adjustment factor
All values are multiplied by the adjustment factor, which is calculated based on `gas_price_estimation_tx_priority`:
```go
	case Priority_Fast:
		return 1.2
	case Priority_Standard:
		return 1.0
	case Priority_Slow:
		return 0.8
```
For fast transactions we will increase gas price by 20%, for standard we will use the value as is and for slow we will decrease it by 20%.

##### Buffer percents
We further adjust the gas price by adding a buffer to it, based on congestion rate:
```go
	case Congestion_Low:
		return 1.10, nil
	case Congestion_Medium:
		return 1.20, nil
	case Congestion_High:
		return 1.30, nil
	case Congestion_VeryHigh:
		return 1.40, nil
```

For low congestion rate we will increase gas price by 10%, for medium by 20%, for high by 30% and for very high by 40%.

We cache block header data in an in-memory cache, so we don't have to fetch it every time we estimate gas. The cache has capacity equal to `gas_price_estimation_blocks` and every time we add a new element, we remove one that is least frequently used and oldest (with block number being a constant and chain always moving forward it makes no sense to keep old blocks).

It's important to know that in order to use congestion metrics we need to fetch at least 80% of the requested blocks. If that fails, we will skip this part of the estimation and only adjust the gas price based on priority.

For both transaction types if any of the steps fails, we fallback to hardcoded values.

### DOT graphs
There are multiple ways of visualising DOT graphs:
* `xdot` application [recommended]
* VSCode Extensions
* online viewers

### xdot
To install simply run `hombrew install xdot` and then run `xdot <path_to_dot_file>`. This tool seems to be the best for the job, since the viewer is interactive and supports tooltips, which in our case contain extra tracing information.

### VSCode Extensions
There are multiple extensions that can be used to view DOT files in VSCode. We recommend using [Graphviz Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EFanZh.graphviz-preview). The downside is that it doesn't support tooltips.

### Goland
We were unable to find any (working) plugins for DOT graph visualization. If you do know any, please let us know.

### Online viewers
There's at least a dozen of them available, but none of them support tooltips and most can't handle our multi-line labels. These two are known to work, though:
* [Devtools/daily](https://www.devtoolsdaily.com/graphviz/)
* [Sketchviz](https://sketchviz.com/)


### Experimental features

In order to enable an experimental feature you need to pass it's name in config. It's a global config, you cannot enable it per-network. Example:
```toml
# other settings before...
tracing_level = "reverted"
trace_outputs = ["console"]
experiments_enabled = ["slow_funds_return", "eip_1559_fee_equalizer"]
```

Here's what they do:
* `slow_funds_return` will work only in `core` and when enabled it changes tx priority to `slow` and increases transaction timeout to 30 minutes.
* `eip_1559_fee_equalizer` in case of EIP-1559 transactions if it detects that historical base fee and suggested/historical tip are more than 3 orders of magnitude apart, it will use the higher value for both (this helps in cases where base fee is almost 0 and transaction is never processed).
